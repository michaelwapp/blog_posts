# Introduction and Implementation of a Slack Workflow Automation for Software Release Processes 

### General Introduction

For one of my last clients, I had the requirement to automate their software release process. The goal was to build a setup-wizard like experience to guide the developer through the release process. This processes consisted of several steps which where execute manually before (think of JIRA Releases Closing, Ticket Status Analysis, Release Note Generation and info messages to several Systems (Email, Teams, Slack)). After debating what tooling to use, the Slack Automation platform was choosen as a perfect solution for this problem. 

The goal of this blog post is to provide you with an introduction to the Slack Automation platform as well as the show you an example of how a Slack Workflow implementation using Deno.js can look like.
